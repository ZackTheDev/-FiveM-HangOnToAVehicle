###### For model creators
If you want this script to support your vehicle model, then you need to add outside seats to the vehicle model.
Example, as you can see in the picture below, the default granger has 8 total seats with 4 of them being on the outside. 
If your model supports this, please contact me so I can add the model to the supported models' list
